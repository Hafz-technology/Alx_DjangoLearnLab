# Advanced API Project:Book and Author Management
This document details the configuration and intended operation of the Django REST Framework (DRF) views defined within the api application, focusing on the five separate generic views implemented for the Book model.
## View Configuration Overview (Generic Views)The CRUD operations for the Book model are implemented using five separate, atomic generic views provided by DRF, allowing for precise control over permissions and URL structure for each action.View NameHTTP MethodEndpoint (e.g., /api/...)DRF Base ClassCustom Hook/SettingBookListViewGETbooks/list/ListAPIViewpermission_classes = [AllowAny]BookDetailViewGETbooks/detail/<pk>/RetrieveAPIViewpermission_classes = [AllowAny]BookCreateViewPOSTbooks/create/CreateAPIViewpermission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]BookUpdateViewPUT/PATCHbooks/update/<pk>/UpdateAPIViewpermission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]BookDeleteViewDELETEbooks/delete/<pk>/DestroyAPIViewpermission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
## Detailed View Operation and Customizations
1. Data Source (queryset)All book views utilize the primary query set: queryset = Book.objects.all(). This ensures that every view operates on the full collection of Book objects in the database.
2. Data Handling (serializer_class)All views use the serializer_class = BookSerializer. This integration ensures:Serialization (Output): When retrieving data (List/Detail), the output format includes the fields specified in the BookSerializer.Validation (Input): When receiving data (Create/Update), the data is validated against the BookSerializer, including the custom validation hook that checks if the publication_year is in the future.
3. Permission Configuration (Custom Hooks)Permissions are the primary customization applied to these views, utilizing DRF's permission_classes attribute to define access rules.Read Operations (BookListView, BookDetailView)Hook: permission_classes = [AllowAny]Effect: Access is granted to all users, regardless of whether they are logged in. This allows public reading of the book catalog.
## Write Operations (BookCreateView, BookUpdateView, BookDeleteView)Hook: permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]Effect: Access is strictly limited to authenticated users. Unauthenticated requests to these endpoints will result in a 401 Unauthorized response. This secures the data modification endpoints from public access.This setup demonstrates how generic views can be quickly customized using the permission_classes hook to enforce fine-grained access control based on the request method and user authentication status.
